# 🚀 Distributed Programming with Java

Create distributed programs using Java primitives. Let's begin with the basics of RMI architecture! 📡

## Basic RMI Architecture

We'll start by defining a remote interface that extends the `Remote` RMI interface. Next, we'll create the actual implementation for this interface using the `MyRemoteObject` class. After that, we'll need just two more components: the server and the client.

Here's the process in a nutshell:

👉 **Step 1:** Create a remote interface that extends `Remote`.

👉 **Step 2:** Implement the interface with the `MyRemoteObject` class.

👉 **Step 3:** Build the server. Create a `MyRemoteObject`, set up a registry, and bind the object to a name.

👉 **Step 4:** Create the client. Lookup the remote object by the name, and you're ready to invoke its methods.

## Advanced Pull Architecture 📶

In the advanced pull architecture, the server app implements a connection component. This component serves as a factory for dialog components. Each connected client is represented by a dialog component, implicitly identified by this component.
